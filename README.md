# Guess-the-number-Project-Adrien

The purpose of the game is to guess a number that is between 1 and 100.
First, we will use an input function to ask the user to pick a number within the same range.
Then a function will generate a random number from a list of number between 1 and 100.
We will make use of a while loop to force the user to change his number if the value he chose was less or greater than the random number we are trying to guess (defensive programming as used in the pre work with the rock paper scissors exercise).
We keep asking the user to change the value until he correctly guessed the random number!
